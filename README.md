**Overview**

This is a very simple game which has a grid and monsters that move every second. One can "kill" monsters by pressing them when they are vulnerable (yellow).

**The purpose of writing this app was to become familiar with:** 

* Mapping the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture to Android
* Understanding the difference between model-view-controller and model-view-adapter (MVA)
* Support for multiple view-controller pairs
* Android application life cycle management
* Defining custom view components in Android
* Handling key presses and touch events
* Background activities using AsyncTask"# Monster-Game"
